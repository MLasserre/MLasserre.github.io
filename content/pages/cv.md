# Research

My thesis subject was about learning continuous bayesian networks from data.
If you want to know more about my work, you can download my
<a href="../pdfs/thesis_lasserre_marvin.pdf" download>*manuscript*</a>
or consult my publications.
More generally I am interested in artificial intelligence and statistics.

# Contributions to open source projects

- **OTaGrUM**, *main contributor*: The otagrum module links Bayesian networks built
with aGrUM to distributions defined with OpenTURNS. Among other things, it allows
to define and estimate Bayesian networks parameterized by local conditional copula
functions for each node (Copula Bayesian Network).

- **aGrUM**, *secondary contributor*: aGrUM is a C++ library for graphical models.
It is designed to easily
build applications using graphical models such as such as Bayesian networks,
influence diagrams, decision trees, GAI networks or Markov decision processes.
pyAgrum is a Python wrapper for the aGrUM C++ library (using the SWIG interface
generator).
